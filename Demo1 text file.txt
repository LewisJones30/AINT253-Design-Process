Currently known bugs:
Movement is only temporary. If you press W and then use the down arrow key at the same time, it will move up instead of down.
Some combinations of the towers of hanoi might not work - Please let me know in the google form.
The text within the puzzle scene is for debugging purposes, it is not going to be present in the final game!
Some hitboxes on some of the poles are a little bit janky, and might not work correctly.
